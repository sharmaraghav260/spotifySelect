# spotifySelect
spotifySelect is a repo to rank songs in a group setting. Users can go over to the webapp, start a session and start adding songs to the queue. The queue is displayed to the users. The users can upvote or downvote to change the order in which the songs should be played. It uses the Spotify API to get the songs. It is written in Python and uses FastAPI for the backend and SolidJS for the frontend. It is currently hosted on Heroku at https://spotifyselect.herokuapp.com/.
